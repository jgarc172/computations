## Computers Compute in Small Steps

Humans also compute in small steps.  Larger problems can be solved by combining solutions to small steps.

## Computers Compute only Numbers using Basic Arithmetic

To use computers to help us solve large and complex problems, we need to understand how small computations can help us
create larger computations.

Humans defined Arithmetic in small increments. From those definition, larger computations can be defined.

## Basic Definitions in Arithmetic (Domain Knowledge)

The domain knowledge in computers is only Arithmetic.  We must understand it first, before we can solve problems in other
domain knowdege areas.

### Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

The operators (functions) are `binary`; that is, they take two operands (arguments)

```
a + b
a - b
a * b  (multiplication)
a / b  (division)
```

When there are more than two operands, associate them by two, as required by the `binary` operators

```
Associate Property:
a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

The association can be started from left or right
```

## Problem

What is the sum of 3 5 8 and 2?

### Write down your proposed solution using your domain knowledge

```
3 + 5 + 8 + 2 = ?
```

### Write down necessary smaller steps using your domain knowledge

Associate two operands at a time from left
```
(3 + 5) + 8 + 2
   8    + 8 + 2
    (8 + 8) + 2
      16    + 2
       (16 + 2)
          18
```          

### Result of the computation

```
3 + 5 + 8 + 2 = 18
```

### Use Memory Helpers (Variables)

The previous steps were using a memory helper by writing down the intermediate result.  You can use a variable to keep
track of the intermediate result.

You can assign a value to a variable, for example `result`.  **Note**: the operator `=` or `<-` indicate setting the contents of variable `x` to the
given value.
```
result = 5
or 
result <- 5

```

You can replace the contents of the variable with other values or expressions.  The expressions can contain the previous value
of the variable

```
r = 5
r = r + 2
r = 5 + 2
r is 7

the final result of r is 7, by replacing the previous value 5 on the right hand side of the = operator
```

Now, let's try using memory helpers in the previous problem to store the temporary computations
```
(3 + 5) + 8 + 2
assign the first computation to r
r = 3 + 5
r = 8

continue with the steps
      r + 8 + 2
    (r + 8) + 2
replace r with the next computation
r = r + 8
r = 8 + 8
r = 16

continue with the steps
          r + 2
replace r with the next computation
r = r + 2
r = 16 + 2
r = 18

the result of all the operations are contained in r
           r
           18
```

## Definitions from Smaller Definition (More Domain Knowledge)

The power of a number is defined from the definition of multiplication
```
x^y = x * x * x * . . . * x for y instances of x (repetition)
```
more general
```
x^y = 1 * x * x * x * . . . * x for y instances of x
```

### Definition
```
a * b is the multiplication of a and b
```

x^0 = 1
x^1 = 1 * x
x^2 = (1 * x) * x
x^3 = 1 * x * x * x
x^y = 1 * x * x * x * . . . * x for y repetitions
